# M3_WiperControlSystem

Wipers are designed and manufactured to remove water from a windshield.The wiper is the beam, and the claws are the suspension components, therefore this is a 
balancing beam with a suspension system. The claws keep the blade flexed against the windshield, distributing uniform pressure across the blade to clean the glass evenly. Large or strongly curved windshields benefit from more claws because they effectively disperse pressure.
